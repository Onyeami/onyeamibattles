 ## Project Objectives
  The objective of Onyeami's Battleships game is to defeat your opponent by sinking all their ships before 
  they sink yours. The game is typically played on a grid. The specific objectives in the game are as follows:

 **Strategically Position Your Fleet**: Before the game begins, each player must position their ships on their grid without the opponent seeing.
   This step is crucial as it sets the stage for the entire game. Players must consider the size and shape of 
   their ships and deploy them in a way that makes them challenging for the opponent to locate and sink.

 **Take Turns to Attack**: Players take turns firing shots at the opponent's grid. The objective is to guess the coordinates where the 
   opponent's ships are located. If a shot lands on a square occupied by an enemy ship, it's a "hit." 
   If it lands in an empty square, it's a "miss."

 **Sink the Opponent's Ships**: The primary goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships. Ships are sunk when every square they occupy has been hit. 
   
 **Win the Game**: The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game. They are declared the victor, and the game concludes.
   
## User Experience
The core objective remains the same: strategically position your ships, take turns to attack your opponent's grid, and sink
their ships before they sink yours.
